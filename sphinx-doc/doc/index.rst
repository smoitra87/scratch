Additional Documentation

General paragraph text
----------------------
This text is going to be *italized*. This is going to be **bold**. 
I feel like defining a lambda function that does not take an argument. I can do this like ``lambda : 1``. 
I even feel like referencing Para2_ cuz I can. I think I will get tired of singing praises of Python_. So I am going to define a shortcut link for it.

.. _Para2:

Welcome to para2. I have so much to say here. I am going to import an image here. I am *soooo* happy |happy|. 
I think this happiness [1]_ can be often be attributed to coding. Let me cite another happiness [HAP2012]_  and let me do it once again [HAP2012]_.

A List of things I like : 

* Food
* Running
	(1) 5K
	(2) Marathon
* Climbing
* Wine

But, how can I be clear, without defining some important stuff:

running
	The act of spontaneous craziness, where your two feet take you far far away 

climbing
	The act of equal madness, where you don't know how to get down after climbing up
